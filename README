build example with `make`.  requires libi2c from i2c-tools and i2c-dev driver.

run with `./testaura <maindev> <auxdev> [<r> <g> <b>]`

maindev is usually the device listed as port 0 for example by i2cdetect
auxdev should be listed as port 4
they take the full dev path eg.: `/dev/i2c-11`.  You'll need to be able to open
and write these devices.

r, g, and b are values from 0 to 255

the library is used by calling `asusaura_open` with the main and aux device
paths passed in.  number of detected devices is returned.  device type (RAM,
Motherboard) can be determined by `asusaura_getType`.  a useful string can be
returned by `asusaura_typeStr`.  `asusaura_update` can be used to pass a new
set of colors to a device index.  the format is an array of 5 sets of 3 8 bit
RGB values totaling 15 bytes.  I haven't tested compatibility with RAM because
I don't have RGB RAM.  when you're done, call `asusaura_close`.

At the moment of this commit (Linux 4.20.0), this requires a patch to the linux
kernel to add support for the AMD KERNCZ piix4 i2c controller on AMD Family 17h
Zen systems.
