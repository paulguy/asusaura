build example with `make`.  requires libi2c from i2c-tools and i2c-dev driver.

run with `./testaura [[<[module.]argument>[=value]] ...]`

global options:
  r (0 - 255) - Red
  g (0 - 255) - Green
  b (0 - 255) - Blue

modules:
  asusaura:
    maindev (string) - Path to main i2c device
    auxdev (string) - Path to aux i2c device

maindev is usually the device listed as port 0 for example by i2cdetect
auxdev I've seen as port 4 or port 1
they take the full dev path eg.: `/dev/i2c-11`.  You'll need to be able to open
and write these devices.

See compyglow.h and arglist.h for information on using the library.

At the moment of this commit (Linux 4.20.0), this requires a patch to the linux
kernel to add support for the AMD KERNCZ piix4 i2c controller on AMD Family 17h
Zen systems.

lspci -nn should indicate this device:
